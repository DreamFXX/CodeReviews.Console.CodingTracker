# Coding Time Tracker

My **Coding Tracker App** for practise of my C# skills. 

This is a practice project that will be submitted for review by csharpacademy.com.
My second C# application with CRUD operations.

## Console based application to track coding habits -> (in Progress)

- Developed using C#, Dapper, SQLite and Spectre.Console.

### For right app start, add system.configuration; !! i removed it because of codacy issues.
